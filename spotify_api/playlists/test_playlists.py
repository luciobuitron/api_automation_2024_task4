    #According Spotify:
    # https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/playlists
    # We have no endpoint for deleting a playlist in the Web API; the notion of deleting a playlist is not relevant within the Spotify’s playlist system.
    # Even if you are the playlist’s owner and you choose to manually remove it from your own list of playlists, you are simply unfollowing it.
    # Although this behavior may sound strange, it means that other users who are already following the playlist can keep enjoying it.
    # Manually restoring a deleted playlist through the Spotify Accounts Service is the same thing as following one of your own playlists that you have previously unfollowed.
